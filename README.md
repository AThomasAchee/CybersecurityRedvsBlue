# Red vs Blue Project
The purpose of this project was to go through both sides of a security attack to a company, starting as a Red Team tester breaking into a web server and then switch to a Blue Team Security Analyst in order to find what had been compromised and suggest mitigation strategies. 

During this project I:
* Found vulnerabilities on a web server and used them to gain access to confidential information located on the server itself. 
* Analyzed the logs of this attack from the point of view of a SOC analyst and determined which files and directories were accessed by this attacker. 
* Consolidated findings from both sides into a report and presented mitigation strategies to harden the server from future attacks.
