The purpose of this project was to go through both sides of a security attack to a company, starting as a Red Team tester and then moving to a Blue Team Security Analyst. 
During this project I:
 <li> Found vulnerabilities on a web server and used them to gain access to confidential information located on the server itself. </li>
 - Analyzed the logs of this attack from the point of view of a SOC analyst and determined which files and directories were accessed by this attacker. 
 - Consolidated findings from both sides into a report and presented mitigation strategies to harden the server from future attacks.
